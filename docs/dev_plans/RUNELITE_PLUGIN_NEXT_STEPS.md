# RuneLite Plugin Development - Next Steps

**Document Purpose:** Strategic roadmap for developing a RuneLite plugin that integrates with the OSRS Snapshot Agent system.

**Created:** 2025-10-26
**Author:** Development Team
**Version:** 1.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision

Create a RuneLite plugin that provides real-time hiscore monitoring and snapshot functionality directly within the Old School RuneScape client. The plugin will leverage our existing OSRS Snapshot Agent infrastructure to provide players with immediate feedback on their progress, stat changes, and achievements.
