## üîç Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Total Level Double-Counting
**Problem**: Reports showed incorrect total levels (1904 instead of 956)
**Root Cause**: "Overall" skill was included in total level calculation
**Solution**: Modified `_total_level()` to exclude "Overall" skill
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Challenge 2: GUI Mode Communication
**Problem**: Users couldn't see what mode was actually resolved vs requested
**Root Cause**: GUI only showed basic "snapshot saved" message
**Solution**: Enhanced GUI with clear mode detection feedback
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Challenge 3: Database Design Complexity
**Problem**: Need efficient time-series analytics while maintaining easy installation
**Solution**: SQLite-first approach with PostgreSQL upgrade path
**Status**: ‚úÖ PLANNED

### Challenge 4: Migration from JSON
**Problem**: Existing users have JSON snapshots that need preservation
**Solution**: Dual storage approach with gradual migration
**Status**: ‚úÖ PLANNED
